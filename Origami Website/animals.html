                    Interesting Facts about Camels

                    Camels have padded feet that help it to walk on soft, wet sand easily.
                    Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
                    Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.
                    Camels can drink 200 liters (53 gallons) of water in three minutes.

                    Interesting Facts about Chameleons

                    Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow some chameleon species to change their skin color, creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, yellow and purple.
                    Chameleon eyes have a 360-degree arc of vision and can see two directions at once.
                    Chameleons do not have an outer or a middle ear so there is neither an ear opening nor an eardrum. However, chameleons are not deaf. They can detect sound frequencies in the range 200–600 Hz.
                    Chameleons can see in both visible and ultraviolet light.

                    Interesting Facts about Cicadas

                    Cicadas are oval-shaped, winged insects that provide a buzzing and clicking song heard in nature throughout the summer. Most cicadas appear every year in late June through August, while others emerge only every few years.
                    "Cicada" comes from the Latin, meaning "tree cricket." While cicadas are oftenreferred to as a kind of locust, they are not part of the locust family.
                    There are about 3,000 known species of cicada worldwide.
                    For the most part, cicadas subsist on the fluids of living trees.

                    Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim.
                    Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!
                    Unlike most other bears, pandas do not hibernate. When winter approaches, they head lower down their mountain homes to warmer temperatures, where they continue to eat bamboo!
                    Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up.

                    Interesting Facts about Pigeons

                    Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.
                    Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.
                    Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.
                    Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.

                    Interesting Facts about Teddy Bears

                    The teddy bear was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.
                    A teddy bear has been into space! Magellan T Bear boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995 as part of a school project.
                    Teddy bears aren’t just for children – 40% of teddy bear sales are for adults, and a quarter of us still has our childhood companion.
                    Bear hugs predate teddy bears by 60 years. The term bear-hug was first recorded in 1846.
